# petprojects
A small collection of my own pet projects to turn me from an okay analyst into a stellar scientist. And other things I find neat.

My name is Ashley. Originally living from the US, I've been living in Berlin since 2018 where i did my masters in experimental linguistics in nearby Potsdam. I've always been fascinated with data and the process of data analysis, from cleaning it to developing insights. I currently work as a data analyst in marketing and consumer insights, and with my skills, I hope to become a data scientist (or engineer, I'm not sure which atm) in a few years time. So here is a place for neat lil' side projects to develop my data skills.

Oh, and I have a dog named Tanuki as featured on my profile pic. I love him so much!
